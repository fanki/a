# hftm Students

This project is developed in the course "Transferprojekt" at [hftm](https://hftm.ch).
The very first step is to ensure every team member has a proper and working setup to work with GitHub and Markdown
files. To do so, every Student is requested to place a small Markdown file into this directory, containing the
experience with technologies and programming languages.
