# Mateusz Kurowski

## Experience

* **Java**: As much as we had in **OOP1 & OOP2**
* **Flutter/Dart**: Currently doing this, actually quite enjoying it also
* **Web HTML/CSS**: As much as we had in classes
* **SQL**: I came from database management, I liked it and understood it, although never used it in the past.  
* **GitHub**: Managing projects for school
