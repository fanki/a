# AnyGUI

**AnyGUI allows building a User Interface within Minutes by just configuring it in a single config file.<br />
Build a GUI for your Machine / Device / Application, which communicates through any IO interface and any protocol.**
<br /><br />
Independent, whether the GUI should communicate through a File, HTTP/S, Websocket, RS232 or any other Interface, 
it can 'communicate' in JSON, XML, Properties File (Key-Value) or in any other Format/Protocol.
<br />
A GUI Widget is missing? You have a proprietary Protocol? - The Plugin approach allows changing or extending it with any 
GUI Widget, IO Interface and Format/Protocol.  
<br />
It is so versatile that even the config file for AnyGUI itself can be made through AnyGUI.

# How to run AnyGUI
To start the application you have to execute this command: 
```bash
mvn javafx:run
```
